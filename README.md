hello-world
===========

I'm betting many first-time programmers accidentally omit the 'o' from hello-world. Ironically, this is the type of world they'll find themselves in if programming isn't for them.

I wrote my first programs in BASIC and ran them on my Commodore 64. We lived in Germany, so my American friends were spread across countless villages dotting the countryside. As such, I had plenty of time to myself to figure things like this out.

My first program was a simple if/then statement that asked for an age. Based on the result, it would output a single line of text. In essence: the program served to tell my Dad (then in his mid-thirties) that he was old.

In middle school, my best friend and I wrote countless DOS batch files to load our extensive collection of Star Wars games, including submenus to boot up dozens of Dark Forces mods.

I took Pascal in high school, and switched to Computer Science in college because I was struggling with my engineering courseload (actually, I was struggling with being a young idiot). Unfortunately, since I was at an engineering school, the CS major was actually a Mathematics major with a CS focus, and the courseload was basically the same as the engineering track. While I loved the course that focused on the history and basics of programming, I was lost in Data Structures, because I was suddenly expected to program in C++ through a UNIX shell. Programming isn't much fun when you struggle with the OS to the point where using an editor (vi, was it?) is excruciatingly tedious.

Long story longer: I dropped out, left Colorado School of Mines, paid back my AFROTC scholarship, and pursued graphic design. An obsessed techie, the programming bug never left me, and I ended up teaching myself HTML and CSS (the graphic design program at the University of Northern Colorado was an emphasis of their Fine Arts degree, so I didn't get much technical instruction there).

Now in my mid-thirties myself, working as a digital designer and digital marketer, I'm coming around to programming again. I've been able to do quite a bit of design coding over the years, even dabbling in PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. I'm fascinated by the prospect of programming for my smartphone platform-of-choice, the struggling Windows Phone.

Where will I go from here?
